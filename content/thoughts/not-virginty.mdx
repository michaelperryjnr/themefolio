So there's like this thing about virginity right? _**And chale**_, do people have **OPINIONS** about it. Like, the kind of opinions that make you wonder **if they've got shares in a purity ring company or something**😂.

I know what you're thinking: _**"Bro, why do you always have these different takes?"**_ Well, what can I say? I just like to poke at ideas until they make sense. And this one? _**It needs some serious poking**_.

...

## The Societal Baggage (Cultural)

Let's address the _**"elephant"**_ in the room, actually.., scratch that, it's more like the _**whole zoo**_ at this point. 🐘 You've heard all those phrases people throw around, right? _**"Save yourself for marriage"**_ like you're some kind of Christmas present, or _**"Stay pure"**_ as if you're a bottle of water. My personal favorite has to be _**"Don't give away your precious gift"**_, this one be hitting sometimes tbh..😂😂

Then we have the whole _**"your worth is tied to your virginity"**_ thing. Like, man, We really need to talk about how messed up that mindset is.

Before we dive deeper, if you haven't checked out my thoughts on **sex**, you might want to head over _[here](/thoughts/so-sex)_ first.<br /> Trust me, it's relevant. 😏

> **"To be pure, we need to be clean and pure"**

> _**Me, just now, feeling philosophical**_ 😂

## The Biblical Truth Bomb 💣

Okay, so here's where it gets interesting. _**Search through the Bible all you want**_, go ahead, I'll wait... you won't find a "virginity rewards program." No heavenly points system, no special VIP pass, **nothing**. It's wild how we've created this whole system of rewards around something that isn't even _**explicitly**_ outlined in scripture.

**But hold up!** Before you close this tab thinking I'm just trying to justify something, let's talk about what the Bible _**actually**_ says about _**sexual purity**_. Yes, it matters, it's about treating your body with _**respect**_, _**honoring God**_, and _**building healthy relationships**_. _**But here's the plot twist**_ that changes everything, look at who God used in even with their **not so saintly** ways .

Think about **Rahab**, _the prostitute_ straight up in _Jesus_'s family tree despite her past. Consider the **woman at the well**, who became the first evangelist to the Samaritans despite her _five husbands_. And let's not forget **Mary Magdalene**, with her complicated history, who was chosen to be the first to see the risen Christ. _**Mind = Blown**_ 🤯

> **"Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, 'The two will become one flesh.'"**
>
> _**1 Corinthians 6:16 (NIV)**_

Now, about that _**"sexual immorality"**_ thing, **_porneia_** in Greek, _I am not a nerd_. Yeah, it includes all the stuff you're thinking about. anything outside marriage, adultery, and probably that other thing you're wondering about too, _yes ma'am, that kiss you thought wasn't a big deal included_.<br /> **But here's the real tea**: _It's not about a checklist of don'ts. It's about understanding why these **boundaries** exist in the first place._

...

## The Logic Check ✅

Let's be real for a second. Your value isn't in your **virginity**, you're not a trading card, you're not deprecating assets, you're a whole human being. And when we look at how _**wild**_ God's grace is, it gets even more interesting. Rahab ended up in Jesus's family tree. **David**, Mr. _**"I saw her bathing on the roof,"**_ was literally called God's favorite. And you? _**Still loved**_, _**still valued**_, _**still worthy**_.

The math just ain't adding up on this whole _"virginity equals automatic holiness"_ equation. If that were true, why did Jesus spend so much time with people society labeled as *"impure"*? _**Think about it**_.
But also, stay with me now👀...

## The Real Talk

Here's what I really want you to get from all this, _**your past doesn't equal your worth**_, but **your choices are still your responsibility**. And most importantly?

And for those still clutching their purity rings so tight their fingers are turning blue: maybe we could all use a little less judgment and a lot more love. Just saying. 😅

> **"Grace isn't about keeping score, it's about starting fresh"**
>
> _**Me, feeling extra wise today**_ 😌

...

## The Bottom Line

So here's the deal, whether you're saving it or already saved the receipt, _**you're still valuable**_. The Bible's more concerned with where you're going than where you've been. Your worth isn't in your virginity, and love will always be greater than labels.

_PS: Dad, Mom, if you're reading this... um... let's pretend this was a book review? 😅_

_PPS: For real though, if you're struggling with shame about this topic, remember: You're not alone, and there's no shame in reaching out for help._

> **"Plot twist: God loves you either way"**

> _**- Captain Obvious, but somehow we keep forgetting this**_

_And that's on periodt! ✨_

## Behind the Scenes

Some would be like, _**"Oh finally! Someone speaking for the streets!"**_ Hold up, hold up, let me stop you right there fam. **😂 This isn't your free pass to go wild**. Like fr fr, some things are still _**red flags**_ and will forever be _**red flags**_:

High body count? _**Nah chale**_, that ain't it. Like, I get it, past is past, but _**if your body count is higher than your credit score... we need to have a different conversation. 😭**_

Sleeping with everyone spontaneously? _**Major red flag**_. Your life shouldn't look like your Snapchat history, come on now. 💀

Being for the streets? _**Definitely not what we're promoting here**_. There's a difference between _**understanding grace**_ and using **it as your VIP pass to wild out**.

Stay with me now...

Cheating because "God will forgive anyway"? _**Chale**_. That's not how this works, that's not how any of this works. 🤦‍♂️

Listen, what I'm saying is _**grace ≠ green light**_ to do whatever you want. It's more like... when you mess up..because let's be real, we all do, you're not permanently marked as damaged goods. But that doesn't mean you should be out here stacking red flags like??..😂

> **"Understanding grace isn't permission to be graceless"**
>
> _**Me, trying to sound deep while spitting facts**_

Think of it like this, Just because your parents will forgive you for crashing their car doesn't mean you should go drag racing on weekends. _**You feel me?**_

And for those in situationships thinking _**"but we're in love"**_... chale, if they wanted to, they would. Don't let these temporary people have permanent effects on your life. _**Trust me on this one**_. 😮‍💨

Get your priorities in check, and yes.. I've written about that too [here](/thoughts/getting-priorities-straight)

_PS: To my future partner reading this... I was young and just explaining things, okay? 😅_

Until we meet again, **LET's BE GUIDED!**
