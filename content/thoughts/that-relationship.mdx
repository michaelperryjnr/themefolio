So I guess we were all wondering when I would finally write on this, **_YES!_**🎉 . I know. <br /> I mean I've written on **sex**🔥, **virginity**👀, **love**❤️ and priorities. Those where the basics, but this is the real deal. And it's going to be **_boringggg_**...🥱
JK.. this is going to be **_funnnnnnnnn_**!!!!!.🔥
But before we discuss that relationship which is obviously not going to lead into marriage, I'd want to clear this out first..<br />
**PS**: *"I'm not a lover boy"*😏

So low-key, we're all **_psychological warfare specialists_** when it comes to relationships... fr. It's from when you're _deliberately_ being **cold**, not because you're genuinely upset, but because _**you want to see how they'll react**_.. yeah, that's our specialty. We create these elaborate scenarios in our heads. Like _"if he doesn't text back in the next 17 minutes, I'll know he's not serious"_ Or the classic one, my personal favorite, _"I'll wait exactly same or more time than he did before I reply, to show him I'm not desperate"_ 🕰️🕷️

And overthinking?? **Lord have mercy**. One blue tick can send us spiraling into an existential crisis. _Did they see my message?_, _Why didn't they respond?_, _Are they ignoring me?_, _Are they with someone else? Are they dead?_<br />_Are they dead with someone else?_... I left this for the dramatic ones actually. 🕵️‍♀️🔍

And let's be real, we've all been there. That moment when your brain turns into a conspiracy theory generator, creating entire soap operas from a single unread message. One minute **you're calm**, the next you're planning **your dramatic exit speech**, complete with imaginary audience applause. It's like our minds are Netflix producers, and we're the stars of the most chaotic _romantic comedy_ ever. 🎬🤯

## The Unspoken Rules of Modern Dating 💔🌐

There's this _**unwritten handbook**_ of modern dating that nobody talks about but everybody follows, a number of these at least for a category of people are _never show too much interest_, _always have a backup plan_, _emotions are for the weak_, _never double text_, _never be the first to say I love you_ and chale it goes on and on. And we're all drowning in them actually. 🏊‍♀️💦

Social media has turned us into these **_performative relationship artists_**. We're curating our relationships and love stories like _**instagram reels**_, _**snapchat stories**_ etc... only showing the highlights, the good parts, the happy moments. And we're all guilty of this. We're all guilty of pretending that everything is perfect, that we're happy. But behind the scenes? It's a messy, complicated, beautiful disaster. 📸❤️‍🩹

We've become masters of the **highlight reel**, careful curators of our digital love stories. One _perfectly angled photo_, _a cryptic caption_ that suggests everything and nothing, and voila! We've just convinced the world... and maybe ourselves that our relationship is **#CoupleGoals**. But ma, we all know the real tea is in the unfiltered, unedited moments that never make it to the **\_'gram**. 🤳🍵

Now let's start this, the usual _**African experience**_, _the newbie variant_. For this usually, _at least one is shy_. And it goes with the _attention_, _long talks_, _the online confidence_, _the dates you'll plan and never go on_, _the "When we get married" part_, then **3-6 months** in the relationship when y'all are getting _"comfortable"_, we get to the interesting part.... **when darkness is everyone's best friend**, unless he doesn't _hold your waist_ or _you don't hold his hand in a certain way_ or _he/she doesn't pull you in closer a bit_.. y'all are looking for the nearest dark corner to do the do. 🌙🔥

Looking at the next variant, the **I think my love story is a Netflix movie** variant, well this is usually happens to the _**delulu**_'s of us. The ones that think they are in a _movie_, and they are the **main characters**. And it's quite fun to watch, but it's not fun to be in. This is the type of relationship that you'll be in, _without a real reality check_ and you'll be thinking you're in a movie. And when the movie ends, you'll be like **"What the hell just happened?"**. Then it's either you become a strong believer in the **Faith**, _a social media influencer_, _the motivational speaker phase_ or _the "I'm never going to love again"_ phase, which is usually the most common. And then you'll be like "I'm never going to love again" and then you'll be in another relationship in 3 months. And the cycle continues.🔄

Seriously, we're out here living like we're in some elaborate romantic comedy script, complete with dramatic monologues and unexpected plot twists. One minute you're the _heartbroken protagonist_, the next _you're the unexpected love interest_ in someone else's story. It's like we're all method actors in the grand theatre of modern love. 🎭❤️

## We are not really looking for commitment🚫

I remember seeing a meme a while ago and it said this...

> **"Boys dey use relationship secure knacks, girls dey use knacks secure relationship"**
>
> _idk who said this, but they cooked!!_

And it's actually true, we aren't looking for serious stuff, most times we just want to have fun then it gets complicated, and we start to **catch feelings**... _this is the painful part_ or sometimes **_fun_** was too good you want to have fun again. Now if you are in this phase, you are either _**going**_ to be _in a relationship that will last for a while_ or you'll be _in a relationship that will last for a while_. And then you'll be like "I'm never going to love again" and then you'll be in another relationship in 3 months. And the cycle continues. 🔄💘

No.... not really

**E just for tear your eye top**🥱👀

**We want depth**, but we're terrified of being _**truly seen**_. **We crave intimacy** but _**build walls**_ higher than the Great Wall of China. One moment we're craving connection, then the next we're pushing people away.. sigh. 🧱❤️

> **"I want you to know me, but I'm scared of you knowing me.. don't you dare get too close"**
>
> _me and my crush in my head_

Let's be real, we're walking contradictions. We write poetry about vulnerability in our notes app but run faster than a thief at risk of being caught when someone tries to get emotionally close. It's like we've got an internal security system more complex than our app locks, but we're secretly hoping someone will find the secret password. 🏃‍♀️🔐

Now rare cases, it's both sides wanting this to work. And usually it's nice that one but those can get very complicated so fast. There's the overthinking, the fault exploiting and the too good to be true phase and if you know what I mean you'll understand why it get's too complicated.
However, there is this particular class of people I'd talk about next. 🎢💑

...

## Let me test them

**Self destruction**, we do it like it's some piece of cake. When things are going too _good_ we want to _find faults_, because we're like **"daughter of Jezebel I'm still waiting for the Season Finale"**, here's the case the finale isn't coming, everything is all too good so now _**I have to become the problem**_. Trust me, **We exist!**. And we don't really want to be the problem but we want to know if you'll stay. Sometimes it's _trust issues_ or _insecurities_ or **_I've been here or seen this before_**, sometimes its neither, _we are just **daredevils**_ 🎢🔍

**YOU**: _the voice in your head reading this having a with your brain_ "He's using **WE** a lot, is he talking about himself or is he talking about a group of people?"<br/>
**Your brain**: "I think he's talking about himself"

**ME AF**: "It's not me wai"<br/>

These daredevils exist regardless. We're the emotional equivalent of test pilots, always pushing the limits, always seeing how much turbulence a relationship can handle before it breaks.<br />**Spoiler alert**: _we often break it ourselves just to prove a point._ 🛩️💥

...

## The Conclusion... Well not really

After going through our emotional and psychological rollercoaster ride, we surprisingly still can't answer or think of answering a quite simple complex question.. **Is this the one?**. <br />
Well, ladies and gentlemen, **I don't know the answer too..**😂😂

But I can say this, \*there are **many ones\***, yeah you heard me right. In fact, scratch that **_anyone_** is a potential one. And I'm not saying this to be a player or to be a heartbreaker, I'm saying this because it's _**true**_. There are **many ones** out there, and you'll find them. **Intentionality** is really the deal here. I mean, one day those butterflies in your stomach would _die_, _disappear_ or _get hungry_.. What happens then??<br />
One day _you won't feel the same way you did when you first met them_, what happens then??<br />
One day _you'll wake up and realize that you're not in love with them anymore_, what happens then??<br />

**This is not a free pass for toxicities, it's a reality check** 🚦❤️

Let me repeat that again, <br />
**DON'T STAND ON THESE TO BE IN A TOXIC RELATIONSHIP** 🛑🚫

And just to drive the point home, _**love is not about finding your other half**_, it's about _**two whole people choosing to walk together. Not completing each other, but complementing each other**_. Big difference. 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️

...

## The End

Okay so this might actually be the end 😂😂... _wipes my non-existent fake tears_
I think we know we're probably not kids so the **sex** and related business stuff... just **be guided**...<br />
And if you're in a relationship, **be intentional**...<br />

And if you're not in a relationship, **be intentional**...<br />

And if you're in a complicated relationship, **be intentional**...<br />

And if you're in a relationship that's not leading anywhere, **be intentional**... no sorry... **you're obviously not going anywhere**<br />

So yeah, **be intentional**... and **be guided**... until we meet again I'd leave you with this quote I stole from the TV Series **The 100**, bruh... they prolly stole it somewhere too I'm sensing🥱

> **"In peace, may you leave this shore. In love, may you find the next. Safe passage on your travels, until our final journey to the ground. May we meet again"**
>
> _The 100, probably stolen... again_
