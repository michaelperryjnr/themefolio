I think it the past weeks and probably month's I've written a lot, I mean I've covered everything.. I left out one part apparently. However, I gave hints...<br />
**Your Mind**: _he hopes you remember..._

I'm going to say it regardless...
But before that, not my proudest moment, but I'd like to put it out there that on every side of the game(dating)... I've been there before.
The main guy, the side guy, the sneaky link, the male bestfriend, the cousin, the friend you shouldn't worry about, the "oh it's not even like that" guy... Mention it?
Trust me I've been there.

So it's safe to say that on all sides of the scale, well... I'm him

Now there's something predominant in most relationship these days...
Probably your's includedðŸ‘€... jk.. not reallyðŸ’€

Some of us have been in toxic relationships and I bet we didn't know that till now.

...

## So what is a toxic relationship?

I am not Sophocles, or Seneca or one of those other guys who couldn't accept that life no balance and move on.. tbvh
Like some stuff they said don't make no sense sometimes...

I think I have to stay on track here...
So toxic, okay, what is a toxic relationship?
In my experience..._i don't have an experience_ I think a toxic relationship is one where one party in the relation... now with this I'm talking about a 2 people relationship, not the other variants y'all have lately... **_open relationship_** seriously??

so where one party in the relationship is being lied to, gaslighted, belittled, manipulated, used, even beaten sometimes on a regular...but they can't leave.
What hurts most is some know that this is not right but they just can't.

...

## Let me cook.

So the whole point of every toxic relationship at least from my point of view is there one emotional and mental mastermind or at least one of the other.

Modern day setting, some us are in or were in toxic relationships because we think that there's nothing good for us out there and we should hold on to what we have.
Well, Mr. or Mrs. Shortsightedness, there's always and I repeat always better.
Infact, it is because of this that I advice people to be intentional in their relationships, becuase if you set out your mind to look for better when you already have someone, not toxic trying for you, you might find it and you might loose what you have.

## We don't know most times

Most times, we don't know we are in toxic relationships because we claim we are in love.
But this is the fun part, I don't even think it's about love.
