Hey there! Let's talk about something that's on everyone's mind but nobody seems to want to discuss openly. You know what I mean - sex. Before I dive in, just know that I'm just a young adult trying to figure things out, just like you. These are my thoughts, my experiences, and hey, maybe they'll help you make sense of things too.

**Quick note**: _This isn't me trying to preach or judge. I'm just here to share what I've learned along the way._<br />
**Ps**: _I'm not a saint_... but I'm not a sinner either. 😇

# Let's Keep It Real

So here's the thing about sex - it's natural. Like, seriously natural. It's literally how we all got here (thanks, Mom and Dad... I guess? 😅). But for something so natural, why do we treat it like this forbidden topic? Why do we whisper about it in corners and act like it's something shameful?

I think a lot of it comes down to how we were raised, right? Between religion, culture, and that awkward "talk" with our parents (if we even got one), we've picked up all these ideas about what sex is supposed to be. Some helpful, some... not so much.<br />
_**Dad, if you're reading this, you won't be a grandpa anytime soon. 😂**_<br />
And _**Mom, please don't call me after reading this. 🙈**_

## The College Scene

_**Let me paint you a picture**_ - I'm in college right now, living in a mixed hostel, and whew boy, do I see some things. You've got people sneaking around like they're in some spy movie, couples trying to be "discrete". _SPOILER ALERT_: **WE KNOW!**, and everyone pretending they don't know what's going on. It would be funny if it wasn't kind of sad.

And you know what? I get it. We're young, we're figuring things out, and yeah, we're curious. Those hormones are doing their thing, and that's totally normal. But here's what I've learned, _**just because something is normal doesn't mean you have to rush into it**_.

## Real Talk About Safety

Now, I know what you're thinking - "Oh great, here comes the lecture about protection." But stay with me now 😂, because this stuff is important, and I'm going to tell you why in a way that actually makes sense.

_**Sex is like swimming**_, it can be amazing and fun, but you wouldn't jump into the ocean without knowing how to swim, right? Same thing here. You need to know what you're doing, not just the fun parts, but the safety parts too. I'm talking about protection, consent, and yeah, those awkward conversations about STIs. Trust me, a moment of awkwardness is way better than a lifetime of regret.<br />
I mean, see the dollar rates.. <em style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Diapers are expensive! 😂</em>

## The Pressure Is Real

Let's talk about something that's been on my mind lately - the pressure. _**Oh chale, the pressure**_. Everyone seems to be doing it _or at least saying they are_, and there's this weird race to lose your virginity like it's some kind of competition. Can we just take a moment to say how messed up that is?

I think _**your body, your rules, your timeline**_. Whether you're waiting for marriage, waiting for the right person, or just waiting until you feel ready, **_that's your choice_**. And anyone who makes you feel bad about that choice? They're not worth your time.

...

## My Personal Take

Now, remember when I said I hadn't tried it yet? Well, _**maybe**_ I have, _**maybe**_ I haven't 😏, but that's not really the point. What matters is understanding that everyone's journey is different. Some people are having the time of their lives, others are waiting, and you know what? Both are totally fine.

What's not fine is being unsafe about it. What's not fine is pressuring others. And what's definitely not fine is judging people for their choices.

...

## Looking Forward

Here's what I wish someone had told me earlier, sex isn't just about the physical act. It's about connection, trust, and yeah, sometimes it's about love _though let's be real, not always_. It's about knowing yourself, respecting yourself, and making choices that you're comfortable with.

_**And here's the most important thing**_, whatever you decide, make sure it's YOUR decision. Not your friends', not your partner's, not society's. Yours.
Please, let me repeat that for the boys at the back, _**THEIR DECISION**_.

> **"The best decisions are the ones you make for yourself, with full knowledge and zero pressure."**
>
> _probably some wise person, but honestly, it just makes sense_

Guess what?? I'm that wise person now 😂.

...

So there you have it, my thoughts on sex, relationships, and figuring it all out. It's messy, it's complicated, but hey, that's part of being human, right?

Stay safe out there, and remember, you're not alone in trying to figure this stuff out. We're all just doing our best, one awkward moment at a time. 😊

And before I forget, _**Dad, Mom, I love you both**_. 😂

> Bro to Bro, **_I'm not ready to be an uncle yet_** 😭😭.

_PS: If you're reading this and feeling overwhelmed, that's totally normal. Take a breath. You've got time to figure things out. And if you need help, there are people and resources out there. Don't be afraid to reach out to [me](mailto:admin@theniitettey.live)_
