## **Been a Minute...**

Not gonna lie, this is the longest I’ve gone without writing. _My bad._ Life’s been **life-ing**, and I’ve learned more in this short time than I usually do in a whole year.

But let’s talk about people for a second. Do we _actually_ understand them?

I, for one, come from a very religious home. And if there’s one scripture my dad loves to throw at me, it’s this:

> **"The heart of man is desperately wicked and beyond cure... Who can understand?"**  
> _Jeremiah 17:9_

And you know what? **He’s got a point.**

Everybody’s your friend until they’re not. 🤷🏽‍♂️

Me? I’m naturally reserved and watchful. Some people think that means I’m clueless... _they have no f\*cking clue._ 😏

So, over time, I developed four simple rules when it comes to dealing with people:

- _see_ 👀
- _notice_ 👁️
- _adapt_ 🔄
- **_say less, notice more_** 🤫

You see what I did there? 😏 Yeah, I said **“notice” twice.** And that’s because it’s the most important one, **notice everything.**

## **They Say It Without Saying It**

> **"People reveal more in silence than in words. Pay attention."**
>
> _Me, feeling **ecclesiastely** ✨_

Ever noticed how when people talk about someone else, they’re usually just _describing themselves_?

**POV: Your brain rn** → _“What tf is bro even saying??”_

Okay, let me break it down for you. There’s this little thing called the **Assh\*le Test**. And it goes like this, so you need two people to meet a third and rate, they do so and you ask them to describe a third person. One says the third person is an assh\*le. The other disagrees. Here’s the plot twist—**both are right.** But **one of them** is the actual assh\*le.

See, people **project themselves** onto others. Whether they’re being fake or real, their _true_ self always slips through. And if you’re sharp enough, you’ll **notice.** 🧐

## **⏳ Time Will Tell**

Time **_always_** tells. It’s the one thing you can count on.

So, I had this friend, right? And for anonymity’s sake, let’s just call them... **“it.”**

Now, _it_ thought _it_ was **so** smart. Like, we'd study together, take the same exams, and I’d even share my grades because, you know, _we’re all students, right?_ 🫠

But guess what? **It** would come and straight-up **lie** about its own grades. **It** was a whole funfooler. 💀

At first, I believed it. Thought we were being honest with each other. **News flash**: _It wasn’t._

How did I figure it out? **Time.**

Because **time exposes everything.** People slip up. They get sloppy. They leave clues. And if you’re paying attention... you’ll _notice._ 👀

> **"Apparently, I forgot the quote I was gonna put here… 💀 sigh 🥲"**
>
> _We go harder next time._

Sometimes, you just have to sit and let time do the work for you... it works, tho it might not always be the best.

Take me for instance, I love **_time will tell_**, don't get me wrong, but I also have this weird reflex action of overthinking and figuring stuff out before they happen, idk whether this is fortunate or unfortunate, but my overthinking is always, **ALWAYS**, right!... _**ps**: he actually doesn't know if it's fortunate or unfortunate_

So just like any caring and understanding human, who wants the best for another, not because of insecurities, or fear or the unkown, _**my alter ego and your mind**: that sounded kinda personal_... I try to help you avoid it, but at the end of the day who's the fool???

**ME**, the biggest fool

pardon me, **YOU**, I want to believe I'm not alone💀

## **💸 Your Energy is Expensive**

You ever realize how **draining** it is to care about the wrong people? 😮‍💨

Like, you could be out here flourishing, but instead, you’re **wasting your energy** analyzing _it_ and its funfoolery.

Listen, energy is **currency**, and guess what? _I’m too broke to be spending it on nonsense._ 🫠

So, lesson learned: **Invest wisely.**

Because at the end of the day...

> **"You've only got you."**

> "_Remember when I said could never be me?? well guess what guys??, today it's me💀_"
> _this is not a quote_

So I undertook something sometime ago, maybe a relationship, maybe a job, maybe my studies, can't really tell... _**ps**: I'm lying, I remember very well_

So about that _**"something"**_, well, I put my heart and my soul into it, from sleepless night, to a walking hollow and nothing seeing your efforts returned, sigh... I saw all that <br />
A wiseman once said, **_Hope's a b\*tch_**, and I should have thought him wiser earlier.

So as I said, I put my all in to this, I wasn't getting anything in return, but whoever/whatever was receiving all these efforts actually got something off it

So fast-forward, **_I had fought the good fight and I had kept the faith_**, I thought, keyword: \_**thought**\_\_ that this was it, now everything looks good, they/it are behaving well, we're pruned the unwanted stuff so I'm going to enjoy now, right??

**Right??**

Well, I'm still waiting for the time when I get to finally enjoy💀<br />
Apparently I have a lot of faith🥲

## **🕹️ Control is a Lie**

You think you’re in control? Cute. 😌

The truth? We just manage variables, tweak settings, and **_hope for the best._** But _real_ control? That’s a myth.

- People will leave. 🚪
- Plans will fail. 📉
- Trust will break. 💔
- People will fall out of love. 💔
- And you? _You’ll still be here._

So when things fall apart?

**Breathe.** No, seriously. Take a deep breath. \_You’re still here. That counts for something. no??, ...**Let it.** Not everything is yours to fix. Some things need to break so you can see what was holding them together in the first place, ...**Adapt.** If you can’t stop the storm, learn to move with it. You’ll make it through.

**Say less, notice more.** _(Told you I was gonna bring that one back.)_

When everything is falling apart, ever just **watch** things crumble, knowing damn well there’s nothing you can do?... like, you _see_ the wreckage before it happens, but it’s like life handed you front-row tickets to the "**Watch It Burn**" show. _**I was listening to Set Fire to the Rain atp**_

And the worst part? **No refunds.**, there's no undo, just a pile up of messes... and it's that bad💀
Sometimes, you do **everything right**, you stay observant, play your cards smart, keep your guard up. And _still_, things go sideways... and in those moments, it’s easy to feel like you’ve lost control. Like you _never_ had it to begin with.

Because guess what? _I'm still guessing too._ 😭😂<br />
Just kidding, here’s the thing: **uncertainty** is part of the game. It’s what makes life unpredictable, and sometimes, even exciting.

So, when you feel like you’re losing control, remember:

- **Embrace the chaos.** 🌪️
- **Learn from the mess.** 📚
- **Grow through the pain.** 🌱

Because...

> "**...every setback is a setup for a comeback. 💪**"
>
> _nah, I cooked on this one fr_

And when you come out on the other side? You’ll be stronger, wiser, and more resilient...so, keep going. Keep pushing. And most importantly, keep believing in yourself. 💖

**NOTE**: Please Ignore that emoji, I'm not "gay"

And when you come out on the other side? You’ll be stronger, wiser, and more resilient...so, keep going. Keep pushing. And most importantly, keep believing in yourself. ✊🏽🔥 _now that's better_

## **👑 You’ve Only Got You**

At the end of the day, when the dust settles, when the fake ones fade, when the world goes quiet **you’ve only got you.**
When you wake up, you go out to see others, but you come back it's still just you...<br />
And you are the only one, who really knows what's going on with you🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽<br />
And that’s not a bad thing.

It means _you_ are responsible for your:  
✅ Peace 🕊️  
✅ Growth 🌱  
✅ Happiness 😊

**No one else.**

So take care of yourself. Protect your energy. And remember:

> **"You are the only constant in your life—invest accordingly."**

nah that's too polite

> **"No one is coming to save you, get up, persist and resist and get shi done"**
>
> _now that's the spirit_

That’s it. That’s the post. **Mic drop.** 🎤💥
