# What's west of westeros? That's where I'm heading

## And this is me! 🎉

So first thought... huh, sighhh... I meant to put an emoji there 😅 ... oops! And here too:

```python
print(f"sighs {possible-emojis}'s")
```

# Don't mind me 🙄

## About Me

So, I started out to create my portfolio website...
Wait, I think this is the part where I do the introduction 🤔

So I'm `The Nii Tettey` — I guess you saw it from the site...

Okay, serious business now! 🦸‍♂️  
I'm Michael Perry Tettey, Batman, Protector of Gotham... (Well, not really, but I like to imagine it)

Sorry, I’m just an 18-year-old, trying to be a computer science major and a software engineer... (You didn’t hear this from me! 😏)

## My Tech Stack 💻

So yeah, I used Next.js, Framer Motion, Contentlayer, and MDX to build this bad boy.  
It's kind of like having my own CMS... How cool is that? 🛠️
Back to the grind — it took me **5 days** to build this, FROM SCRATCH! 💪

_"I can’t believe I built this in 5 days!"_
